## Testing

The game was tested constantly during its development process.
Other users also tested it in order to spot possible bugs and mistakes that the code may present.

### Validators

CI python linter [online validation tool](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) was used to ensure that all of the project's Python source code is [Pep 8-compliant](https://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). This checking was done manually by copying python code and pasting it into the validator.

No errors were found:
